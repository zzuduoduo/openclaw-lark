This is the official Lark/Feishu plugin for OpenClaw, developed and maintained by the Lark/Feishu Open Platform team. It seamlessly connects your OpenClaw Agent to your Lark/Feishu workspace, enabling it to directly read from and write to messages, docs, bases, calendars, tasks, and more.

## Features

This plugin provides comprehensive Lark/Feishu integration for OpenClaw, including:

| 📄 Docs | Create, update, and read documents |
| 📊 Base | Create/manage bases, tables, fields, records (CRUD, batch operations, advanced filtering), views |

- **🔒 Permission Policies**: Flexible access control policies for DMs and group chats
- **⚙️ Advanced Group Configuration**: Per-group settings including allowlists, skill bindings, and custom system prompts

## Security & Risk Warnings (Read Before Use)

This plugin integrates with OpenClaw AI automation capabilities and carries inherent risks such as model hallucinations, unpredictable execution, and prompt injection. After you authorize Lark/Feishu permissions, OpenClaw will act under your user identity within the authorized scope, which may lead to high-risk consequences such as leakage of sensitive data or unauthorized operations. Please use with caution.

To reduce these risks, the plugin enables default security protections at multiple layers. However, these risks still exist. We strongly recommend that you do not proactively modify any default security settings; once relevant restrictions are relaxed, the risks will increase significantly, and you will bear the consequences.

We recommend using the Lark/Feishu bot connected to OpenClaw as a private conversational assistant. Do not add it to group chats or allow other users to interact with it, to avoid abuse of permissions or data leakage.

Please fully understand all usage risks. By using this plugin, you are deemed to voluntarily assume all related responsibilities.
